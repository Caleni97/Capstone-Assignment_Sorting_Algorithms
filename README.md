# Capstone-Assignment_Sorting_Algorithms
 NOTE: as part of the experimental work, all sorting algorithms must be applied to a variety of sizes (small/medium/large/very large) of arrays/arraylists initialised to consist of randomly sorted integers in the range 0 â€“ int.MaxValue.  At least 30% of the integers in the list should be duplicated at least 5 times.  Sorting algorithms must sort the lists in descending order. To provide evidence of accuracy of sorting algorithms, your main program must also be able to sort an unknown number of integers sourced from a provided text file (1 integer per line).
